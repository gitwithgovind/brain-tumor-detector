# üß† Brain Tumor Detection Framework
_A deep learning-based framework for automated detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)._

## üîç Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images and classifying them into respective tumor types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Developed as part of a real-world team project, it demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in the healthcare domain.
- üöÄ Achieved 95.30% classification accuracy on validation data.

## üö© Problem Statement
Brain tumors are among the most dangerous forms of cancer due to their rapid progression and the critical nature of brain functions. According to the American Brain Tumor Association, approximately 700,000 people in the U.S. are living with a primary brain tumor, and over 18,000 deaths occur annually due to brain tumors. <br>

Late diagnosis is a major contributor to poor survival rates: <br>
A study by the National Cancer Institute highlights that early detection can increase survival chances by up to 70%, but many cases go undetected until symptoms become severe. <br>

‚Ä¢Key challenges in brain tumor diagnosis: <br>
‚ùå MRI analysis requires significant time and expert interpretation. <br>
‚ùå Limited availability of radiologists, especially in under-resourced regions. <br>
‚ùå High error rates due to fatigue and subjectivity in manual diagnosis. <br>

‚Ä¢Our Solution: <br>
This project proposes an AI-driven detection and classification system that: <br>
‚úÖAutomatically processes MRI scans. <br>
‚úÖAccurately identifies the presence of a tumor. <br>
‚úÖClassifies it into types (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary). <br>
By using deep learning, this system aims to bridge the gap in early tumor diagnosis, especially in scenarios where radiological expertise is limited or delayed. <br>
